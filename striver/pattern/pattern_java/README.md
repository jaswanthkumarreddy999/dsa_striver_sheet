# Pattern Programs in Java

This directory contains various pattern programs implemented in Java. The patterns are organized by their type and complexity.

## Pattern Types
1. Basic Patterns (1-5)
   - Square patterns
   - Triangle patterns
   - Number patterns

2. Intermediate Patterns (6-10)
   - Pyramid patterns
   - Diamond patterns
   - Character patterns

3. Advanced Patterns (11-15)
   - Complex geometric patterns
   - Spiral patterns
   - Special character arrangements

4. Expert Patterns (16-22)
   - Complex number patterns
   - Advanced geometric patterns
   - Special arrangements

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the specific pattern directory
2. Compile the Java file: `javac PatternName.java`
3. Run the program: `java PatternName`
4. Enter the size of the pattern when prompted

## Note
Each pattern program takes an integer input 'n' which determines the size of the pattern.
